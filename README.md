# Ceaser_cipher
(micro-project in python) 
This is an illustration of Julias Ceaser's epic cipher he used to code his military messages, 
though this is not used anywhere in cryptography today, yet it's building block for ciphers like  VigenÃ¨re cipher, 
and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. The code can encrypt and decrypt a given sentence.
